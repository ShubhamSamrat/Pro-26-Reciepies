# Homemade Veggie Pizza


Of course, you could just order out, but nothing beats a homemade pizza. The sauce is so easy and hearty everyone will think you were in the kitchen all day cooking this up!



## Cook's Notes:
This recipe will make two medium-sized pizzas. You can bake two or freeze one to save for a later date.

This will make more sauce than needed but it freezes great!
